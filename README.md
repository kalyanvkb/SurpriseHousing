# Surprise Housing Regression Assignment
> Problem Statement
US Based housing company Surprise housing planning to enter into Australian market with an intent to purchase houses below their fair value and sell them in profits. Goal is to build the regression model to predict the fair value prices using regularization techniques learnt in the course.

The company would like to understand the significant factors that are important in predicting the price of a house and the weightage of these fields.

## General Information
- Surprise Housing wanted to predict the price of a house using the data set and ML model.
- Problem Statement
	- understand the features of the house that are significant in pricing the house.
	- weightage of these fields/features in the pricing of a house.
- Datasets used: 
  Surprise Housing Dataset provided by upgrade
	
## Conclusions
- RIDGE and LASSO regression models along with Linear Regressionare evaluated and models were build to predict the variables that are consitituting to the house pricing significantly.
- After building the moderl, the summary is that the Housing customers are interested in Neighborhood, sq.ft area of ground floor, 1st floor, 2nd floor and these fields consititure the pricing of the house heavily
- Lasso seems to be simpler and more optimized with better results on unknown data.
- Size of the Garage, Build quality of basement, Foundation, exterior, Overall Quality of the house, House Style decide the pricing more than other fields of the house.


## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.11.5
- matplotlib - 3.7.2
- Pandas - 2.0.3
- seaborn - 0.12.2
